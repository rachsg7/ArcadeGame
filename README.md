# Overview

In order to learn the basics of Pyarcade and a map-making program called Tiled, I created this simple game. 

To play, you can use ASD to move around, and space to jump. The game is not functioning well enough for the character to die when they fall off the map, or to respawn.
This was just to get enough experience to move the character around and get a map made.

# Development Environment

This was made in Visual Studio Code using Python with the Pyarcade library.
